# Rust Tokio Thread-Local Example

This repository contains a Rust program demonstrating how to use Tokio to achieve thread-local storage functionality. Thread-local storage allows you to have variables that are local to each thread, ensuring isolation and avoiding data races.

## Requirements

- Rust programming language (https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Tokio asynchronous runtime (https://tokio.rs/)
